  In skyAdmin 2.5.2, the session engine has been fixed. Session ends when the database did not have the information of the session when the user has it.

  In skyAdmin 2.5.1, the common error of template.inc.php can be averted. By defining ENABLE_SKYADMIN_THEME as false. This would tell skyAdmin to not use any
  theme.

  Like so:
  
  <?php
    define('ENABLE_SKYADMIN_THEME', FALSE);
  ?>
